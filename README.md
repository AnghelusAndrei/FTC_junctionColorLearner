# FTC_junctionColorLearner
This is an Interface designed for FTC team 19071 SmartCluster in the powerplay season.
Its purpose is to train Neural Network models to recognise a certain color accurately and accounting for lighting conditions and exporting the models as a lookup table for each color so it can be downloaded on the robot's control hub.
It is part of a more complex vision system designed to detect junctions and automatically position the robot in scoring position relative to the best possible junction found.
